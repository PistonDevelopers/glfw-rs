# glfw-rs

GLFW bindings and wrapper for The Rust Programming Language.

## Example

~~~rust
extern crate glfw;

use glfw::{Action, Context, Key};

fn main() {
    let glfw = glfw::init(glfw::FAIL_ON_ERRORS).unwrap();

    let (window, events) = glfw.create_window(300, 300, "Hello this is window", glfw::WindowMode::Windowed)
        .expect("Failed to create GLFW window.");

    window.set_key_polling(true);
    window.make_current();

    while !window.should_close() {
        glfw.poll_events();
        for (_, event) in glfw::flush_messages(&events) {
            handle_window_event(&window, event);
        }
    }
}

fn handle_window_event(window: &glfw::Window, event: glfw::WindowEvent) {
    match event {
        glfw::WindowEvent::Key(Key::Escape, _, Action::Press, _) => {
            window.set_should_close(true)
        }
        _ => {}
    }
}

## Using glfw-rs

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [compiled and installed GLFW 3.x](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html).
You might be able to find it on your package manager, for example on OS X:
`brew install --static glfw3` (you may need to run `brew tap homebrew/versions`).
If not you can download and build the library
[from the source](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html) supplied on the
GLFW website. Note that if you compile GLFW with CMake on Linux, you will have
to supply the `-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-fPIC` argument. You may install GLFW to your
`PATH`, otherwise you will have to specify the directory containing the library
binaries when you call `make` or `make lib`:

~~~
GLFW_LIB_DIR=path/to/glfw/lib/directory make
~~~

### Including glfw-rs in your project

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

~~~toml
[dependencies.glfw]
git = "https://github.com/bjz/glfw-rs.git"
~~~

#### On Windows

On Linux and OS/X `glfw-rs` will automatically compile the `glfw` library.
However on Windows you will need to provide `libglfw3` yourself. To do so, put
the precompiled library in `C:\Users\<you>\.rust`.

### Building and running the examples

Run `cargo test`, then `./target/test/<example_name>`.
