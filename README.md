# glfw-rs

GLFW bindings and wrapper for The Rust Programming Language.

## Example code

~~~rust
extern mod native;
extern mod glfw;

#[start]
fn start(argc: int, argv: **u8) -> int {
    // Run GLFW on the main thread
    native::start(argc, argv, main)
}

fn main() {
    // Set up an error callback
    glfw::set_error_callback(~ErrorContext);

    // Initialize the library
    do glfw::start {
        // Create a windowed mode window and its OpenGL context
        let window = glfw::Window::create(300, 300, "Hello this is window", glfw::Windowed)
            .expect("Failed to create GLFW window.");

        // Make the window's context current
        window.make_context_current();

        // Loop until the user closes the window
        while !window.should_close() {
            // Swap front and back buffers
            window.swap_buffers();

            // Poll for and process events
            glfw::poll_events();
        }
    }
}

struct ErrorContext;
impl glfw::ErrorCallback for ErrorContext {
    fn call(&self, _: glfw::Error, description: ~str) {
        println!("GLFW Error: {:s}", description);
    }
}

## Compilation

You will need [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) to set up glfw-rs for building.

You can use [cargo-lite](https://github.com/cmr/cargo-lite):

~~~
cargo-lite.py install --git https://github.com/bjz/glfw-rs.git glfw-rs
~~~

Or do it manually:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/bjz/glfw-rs.git
cd glfw-rs
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
~~~


### Building everything

~~~
make
~~~

### Building the library

~~~
make lib
~~~

### Building the examples

~~~
make examples
~~~

Or to build a single example:

~~~
make <example-name>
~~~


## FAQ

_I get lots of errors like: `undefined reference to 'glfwSetScrollCallback'`_

glfw-rs wraps [glfw 3.0](http://www.glfw.org/). Version 2.7 was out for a
_long_ time, and may still be hanging around on package managers. If you
encounter these kinds of errors, make sure you version of glfw is up to date.

_Ok, so I have windowing sorted, now where do I find OpenGL?_

You can use the function pointer loader, [gl-rs](https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs),
or the [OpenGL-ES bindings](https://github.com/mozilla-servo/rust-opengles).
