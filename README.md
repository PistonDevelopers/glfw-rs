GLFW bindings and wrapper for The Rust Programming Language.

## Example

~~~rust
extern crate glfw;

use glfw::{Action, Context, Key};

fn main() {
    let mut glfw = glfw::init(glfw::fail_on_errors).unwrap();

    let (mut window, events) = glfw.create_window(300, 300, "Hello this is window", glfw::WindowMode::Windowed)
        .expect("Failed to create GLFW window.");

    window.set_key_polling(true);
    window.make_current();

    while !window.should_close() {
        glfw.poll_events();
        for (_, event) in glfw::flush_messages(&events) {
            handle_window_event(&mut window, event);
        }
    }
}

fn handle_window_event(window: &mut glfw::Window, event: glfw::WindowEvent) {
    match event {
        glfw::WindowEvent::Key(Key::Escape, _, Action::Press, _) => {
            window.set_should_close(true)
        }
        _ => {}
    }
}

## Using glfw-rs

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [compiled and installed GLFW 3.x](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html).
You might be able to find it on your package manager, for example on OS X:
`brew install glfw3` (you may need to run `brew tap homebrew/versions`).
If not you can download and build the library
[from the source](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html) supplied on the
GLFW website. Note that if you compile GLFW with CMake on Linux, you will have
to supply the `-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-fPIC` argument. You may install GLFW to your
`PATH`, otherwise you will have to specify the directory containing the library
binaries when you call `make` or `make lib`:

~~~
GLFW_LIB_DIR=path/to/glfw/lib/directory make
~~~

### Including glfw-rs in your project

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

~~~toml
[dependencies.glfw]
version = "*"
~~~

#### On Windows

By default, `glfw-rs` will try to compile the `glfw` library. If you want to link to your custom
build of `glfw` or if the build doesn't work (which is probably the case on Windows), you can
disable this:

~~~toml
[dependencies.glfw]
version = "*"
default-features = false
~~~

### Raw window handle 0.5.0 compatibility

By default, `glfw-rs` uses raw-window-handle at v0.6.0. If your project is depending on `glfw-rs`
with raw-window-handle v0.5.0, then use this line in your Cargo.toml:
~~~
glfw = { version = 0.56.0 , default-features = false, features = ["with-window-handle-v0-5"] }
~~~
